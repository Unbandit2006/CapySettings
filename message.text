Very close to release

Current progress:
  [x] Fix CapySettings_AddSetting to not add multiple settings of the same name.

  [x] Fix library for linux. Skeeto reported bug, I got the same results.
	  [x] Change reading to be buffer based
	  [x] New function CapySettings_LoadFromFile(FILE* pFile, bool debug);
		Purpose is to leave opening to developer, and simply create the proper structs

  [] Implement Ada notation
	For example:
	  Variable1, Variable2, Variable3: Integer = 1, 2, 3
